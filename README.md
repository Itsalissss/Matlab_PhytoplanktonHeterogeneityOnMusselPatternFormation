# Matlab_PhytoplanktonHeterogeneityOnMusselPatternFormation_2021

Project developed at Utrecht University during the Energy Science master thesis course in Environmental System Analysis. 
It has been developed on MatLab and regards the calculation of the effect phytoplankton heterogeneity has on mussel self-organization pattern formation.
Dissimilarly to the other Matlab projects, this one has been entirely developed base on two papers instead of being based on information given in the course.

Papers:
Mukhopadhyay, B., and R. Bhattacharyya. "A delay-diffusion model of marine plankton ecosystem exhibiting cyclic nature of blooms." Journal of biological physics 31.1 (2005): 3-22.
